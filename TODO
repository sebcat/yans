# TODO

- The current curl binary port depends on a lot of shit. Either
  build/install from ports, or introduce it as a in-tree 3rd_party
  dependency

- Add patterns for finding software components and map them to services by
  ID.
  e.g.,
  Found Components
  ID,Vendor,Product,Version
  1,foo,bar,1.2.3

  Found Components by Service
  Service ID,Component ID
  1,1
  ...

- webfetch module: reqfinder (sigil-gumbo based)

- yans-fe: Make HTML tables sortable (sort.js) have spinner to indicate
           when sorting

- Write wrapper for qsort_r which deals with various arg orders
- Continue to work on Linux version

## grab-banners,reaplan,tcpsrc

kng_mod_fini, - make sure it works the way it is intended
  (kng_mod_fini has no SIGCHLD handler, so no EINTR in
  nanosleep?) and don't wait more in stop_service_listeners than needed.

reaplan: handle_tls_handshake - if the handshake fails we should still
  write an empty banner in grab-banners. Implement, verify with test case
  of a server sending a TLS Alert.

## unsorted

- Currently, a hard restart prevents services from starting again due to
  existing PID-files. Clean pidfiles on service start (potential issues
  if service is started two times?)
- Do not wait while shutting down a service if all children are terminated
- sync index vs job.json times - queued or started? Maybe no duplication?

## lib/net/url
  - url_normalize: if we have a percent-encoding to a valid char, decode it

## lib/net/ip
  - make it possible to add/remove an address/range to/from a range
  - have contains work on current instead of first?

## To add
  - SSDP, MDNS, ICMP multicast for host discovery on LAN
  protocols: dns, ssh, ftp, http, smtp, pop3, imap, vnc, rdp
  functionality: enumeration of capabilities (cipher suites, commands, &c)
                 default account testing
