## ethd
  - interfaces and stuff are loaded at boot, may change during uptime

## lua
  - move fd from ycl to its own lib, maybe move fts to the same lib (file?)
  - receive/transmit buffers for fd
  - event driven poll
  - callback system in lua, similar to eds. on_next_fd, on_readable,
    on_writable, on_done

Netfsm = require "netfsm"
Cli = {...} -- load like: require"drivers.foo"
function Cli:new(opts) ... end
function Cli:on_next_fd() ... end
function Cli:on_readable(fd) ... end
function Cli:on_writable(fd) ... end
function Cli:on_done(fd) ... end
driver = Cli:new()
Netfsm:new{
  nconcurrent = 10,
  nsec_timeout = 10,
  driver = driver,
}:run()

## ethframe
  - SSDP, MDNS, ICMP multicasts
  - choose sequential/procedurally generated/PRNG source port within suitable
    range instead of hard-coding?
  - generate packet generators from DSL?

## lib/net/url
  - url_normalize: if we have a percent-encoding to a valid char, decode it?

## lib/net/ip
  - make it possible to add/remove an address/range to/from a range
  - have contains work on current instead of first?

## new services

  - bannerd: UDP/TCP banner grabbing with (D)TLS support (libressl?)
  - tlshellod: TLS negotiation w/ STARTTLS
  - spiderd: HTTP crawler (or HTTP proxy?)
    * have a file with requests (raw HTTP requests?), pass it to the daemon
      which generates a file with responses. Parse responses and generate new
      requests. How to find requests? Have identity hash mapped to offsets?

## distribution
  - Yocto linux based? NanoBSD based?( XXX NanoBSD is obsolete) Homebrewn
    FreeBSD dist?
  - .vmdk image
  - read-only fs
  - /var/yans as tmpfs/md(4)
  - nginx
  - /usr/share/www/a1
  - API implemented as yans CGIs, with implicit seccomp-bpf/capsicum
    on cgi.init

more areas:
  protocols: dns, ssh, ftp, http, smtp, pop3, imap, vnc, rdp
  functionality: enumeration of capabilities (cipher suites, commands, &c)
                 default account testing
