# TODO

- Adjust size of /var depending on available RAM

- curl from ports is built with kerberos. Building curl
  without kerberos (and without some other cruft in libcurl) and running
  make buildworld with WITHOUT_KERBEROS=true saves a couple of MBs

- webfetch module: reqfinder || crawler || other-name (sigil-gumbo based?)

- yans-fe: Make HTML tables sortable, have spinner to indicate when sorting

- Write wrapper for qsort_r which deals with various arg orders

- Continue to work on Linux version

- kng_mod_fini, - make sure it works the way it is intended
  (kng_mod_fini has no SIGCHLD handler, so no EINTR in
  nanosleep?) and don't wait more in stop_service_listeners than needed.

- reaplan: handle_tls_handshake - if the handshake fails we should still
  write an empty banner in grab-banners. Implement, verify with test case
  of a server sending a TLS Alert.

- Currently, a hard restart prevents services from starting again due to
  existing PID-files. Clean pidfiles on service start (potential issues
  if service is started two times?)

- Do not wait while shutting down a service if all children are terminated

- sync index vs job.json times - queued or started? Maybe no duplication?

- url_normalize: if we have a percent-encoding to a valid char, decode it

- url_normalize: Add host case normalization

- lib/net/ip: make it possible to add/remove an address/range to/from a
  range

- lib/net/ip: have contains work on current instead of first?

- add: SSDP, MDNS, ICMP multicast for host discovery on LAN
  protocols: dns, ssh, ftp, http, smtp, pop3, imap, vnc, rdp
  functionality: enumeration of capabilities (cipher suites, commands, &c)
                 default account testing
