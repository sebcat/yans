# TODO

- BUG: sc2 'lifetime exceeded' for non-existing child. Have max kill
  retries and/or check kill return value, as well as fix signal handling
  code (sigchld when reaping?)

- BUG: ::1 successful connection to :53, however it is not listed in
       collation

- Make HTML tables sortable (sort.js)

- Write wrapper for qsort_r which deals with various arg orders
- Continue to work on Linux version

UI issues:
  - alternating between entries duplicate content

## grab-banners,reaplan,tcpsrc

kng_mod_fini, - make sure it works the way it is intended
  (kng_mod_fini has no SIGCHLD handler, so no EINTR in
  nanosleep?) and don't wait more in stop_service_listeners than needed.

reaplan: handle_tls_handshake - if the handshake fails we should still
  write an empty banner in grab-banners. Implement, verify with test case
  of a server sending a TLS Alert.

tcpsrc: Implement TCPSRC_ALLOW, TCPSRC_DISALLOW. Make ioctl device-/system
  wide and have rc script setting ranges at boot?
tcpsrc: have separate device for ALLOW/DISALLOW? Should not be possible
  to change from sandbox (e.g., /dev/tcpsrc, /dev/tcpctl)

## unsorted

- yans-fe: If 1) is selected, then 2) then 1) again: report entries are
  appended. Make them replace instead of append

- Currently, a hard restart prevents services from starting again due to
  existing PID-files. Clean pidfiles on service start (potential issues
  if service is started two times?)
- Do not wait while shutting down a service if all children are terminated
- store index --name-must-match?

- sync index vs job.json times - queued or started? Maybe no duplication?

## ethd
  - interfaces and stuff are loaded at boot, may change during uptime

## lib/net/url
  - url_normalize: if we have a percent-encoding to a valid char, decode it?

## lib/net/ip
  - make it possible to add/remove an address/range to/from a range
  - have contains work on current instead of first?

## To add
  - SSDP, MDNS, ICMP multicast for host discovery on LAN
  protocols: dns, ssh, ftp, http, smtp, pop3, imap, vnc, rdp
  functionality: enumeration of capabilities (cipher suites, commands, &c)
                 default account testing
